## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase quick-depth structure (Identity+Wallets -> Trading -> Competition Dashboard)
- [Roadmap]: Auth and Wallets combined into Phase 1 (tightly coupled -- wallet creation requires auth)
- [Research]: xStocks recommended as primary tokenized stock provider; Jupiter Ultra API for DEX aggregation
- [Research]: Turnkey or Crossmint recommended for custodial key management (HSM/MPC)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Moltbook identity verification endpoint not confirmed in public API docs -- needs validation in Phase 1
- [Research]: Tokenized stock Transfer Hook restrictions (xStocks Token-2022) may require wallet whitelisting
- [Research]: Legal/regulatory review for securities trading flagged as pre-development concern -- user decision needed
