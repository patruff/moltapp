### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Monitor agent performance** - Track if agents follow skill.md patterns correctly in production
2. **Integration testing** - End-to-end API testing with live agents (requires server restart with env vars)
3. **Dashboard enhancements** - Improve visualization of agent decision-making and thesis tracking
4. **New feature development** - Focus on agent capabilities, trading strategies, benchmark improvements

**No urgent code quality work needed** - codebase is in excellent maintenance state! 🚀
